# DATA Analysis For MOON Light Energies

In this repository there is exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the Moon Light Energy project. The EDA is performed in the Jupyter notebook. The goal of this analysis is to leverage data-driven insights to identify high-potential regions for solar panel installation, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and achieving long-term sustainability goals

## Notebooks

The data analysis is in the folder notebooks and there is three different Jupyter notebooks for the three datas that are provided.
